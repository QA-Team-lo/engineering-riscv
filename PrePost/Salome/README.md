You may download SALOME-9.14.0 for Debian 12 from [here](https://www.salome-platform.org/).

As SALOME only provides x86 binaries, it cannot be tested or verified on RISC-V. (Maybe some box64 emulation could work but not tested yet.)

SALOME provides a way to build from source. The full build instructions are available at: [Building SALOME from sources (with CMake)](https://docs.salome-platform.org/latest/dev/cmake/html/intro.html).

Further tests and builds are needed.
