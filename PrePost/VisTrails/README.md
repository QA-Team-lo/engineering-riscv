### **Status Report: VisTrails on RevyOS (RISC-V)**

#### Objective

This report documents the process of installing and attempting to run the `vistrails` package on a RevyOS system using a Python 3.13 environment. The package installed successfully but failed at runtime.

#### 1. Successful Installation Steps

A virtual environment was created using `uv` with the system's native Python 3.13 interpreter. The command `uv pip install vistrails` was executed and completed successfully.

#### 2. Observed Runtime Failure

Upon attempting to launch the application with the `vistrails` command, the program terminated immediately. The following `SyntaxError` was produced:

```log
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/debian/vistrials/.venv/bin/vistrails", line 4, in <module>
    from vistrails.run import main
  File "/home/debian/vistrials/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/vistrails/__init__.py", line 58, in <module>
    from vistrails.core.api import *
  File "/home/debian/vistrials/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/vistrails/core/api.py", line 155
    vistrail.add_action(action, 0L)
                                ^
SyntaxError: invalid decimal literal
```

#### 3. Analysis of Failure

The error points directly to the code `0L`. The `L` suffix for an integer is syntax specific to Python 2. This syntax was removed in Python 3. The Python 3.13 interpreter therefore cannot parse this code, causing the `SyntaxError`. This indicates the VisTrails source code was written for a Python 2 runtime.

#### 4. System Environment Context

A check of the system's package manager (`apt search python2`) confirms that a Python 2 runtime is not available in the standard software repositories for this RISC-V platform.

#### Conclusion

The `vistrails` package cannot run in a Python 3 environment due to the use of Python 2-specific syntax in its source code. A direct solution is impeded by the absence of a readily available Python 2 environment on this system.

#### Suggestion

Providing a self-contained build of VisTrails that bundles a compatible Python 2 runtime would be a good solution. This would enable the application to run on modern platforms like RISC-V where a system-level Python 2 installation is unavailable.
