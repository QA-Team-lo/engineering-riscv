Caret is a free, open-source, software package for structural and functional analyses of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex. Caret runs on Apple (Mac OSX), Linux, and Microsoft Windows operating systems.

Caret software includes two main programs, caret5 and caret_command. caret5 is a graphical user interface (GUI) for interactively manipulating and viewing neuroimaging data. caret_command is a command line program that allows batch processing of neuroimaging data.

> NOTE: Caret is no longer being developed. Connectome Workbench is the successor to Caret, and can do many of the same things, while having better controls and new features. It is available here, and is also open source.

You could turn to [Caret:Download](https://web.archive.org/web/20171028131844/http://brainvis.wustl.edu/wiki/index.php/Caret:Download) wiki page archived at 2017 for download links.

But all of the links are not archived by Wayback Machine. [Search for "Caret" in Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://brainmap.wustl.edu/pub/caret/*) we found some links about "Linux32": https://web.archive.org/web/20150801194725/http://Rabbit:Carrot@brainmap.wustl.edu/pub/caret/caret_distribution_Linux32.v5.65.zip.

This zip only provides Linux32 binaries for GNU/Linux 2.6.8. These are difficult to run on modern x86 Linux systems, and are incompatible with riscv64 RevyOS appearently.

On caret's homepage, it recommends to use Connectome Workbench for replacment. Futher research is needed if there are urgent needs for softwares like Caret (on RISC-V platform).
