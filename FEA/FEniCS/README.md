### **Guide: Installing FEniCS on RevyOS**

This document provides instructions for installing `FEniCS` on a RISC-V device running RevyOS. Since the `fenics` package is available in the RevyOS repositories, the installation process is very straightforward.

---

#### **Installation**

You can install it using the `apt` package manager:

```bash
debian@revyos-lpi4a:~$ sudo apt install fenics
debian@revyos-lpi4a:~$ fenics-version
2019.2.0.dev0
debian@revyos-lpi4a:~$ python3
Python 3.11.4 (main, Jun  7 2023, 10:13:09) [GCC 12.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import dolfin
>>> print(dolfin.__version__)
2019.2.0.dev0
>>>
```

#### **Availability Test**

For the following program that solves the Poisson equation:

```python
from fenics import *

mesh = UnitSquareMesh(8, 8)
V = FunctionSpace(mesh, 'P', 1)

u_D = Constant(0.0)
def boundary(x, on_boundary):
    return on_boundary
bc = DirichletBC(V, u_D, boundary)

u = TrialFunction(V)
v = TestFunction(V)
f = Constant(-6.0)
a = dot(grad(u), grad(v)) * dx
L = f * v * dx

u = Function(V)
solve(a == L, u, bc)

print("Min/Max of solution:", u.vector().min(), u.vector().max())
```

Run it with `fenics`:

```bash
debian@revyos-lpi4a:~/fenics$ python3 demo.py

```

This demonstrates that `fenics` has basic functionality on RevyOS.
